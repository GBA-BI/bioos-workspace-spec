# Bio-OS Workspace Specification
Bio-OS, short for Bio-medical Big Data Operating System, is an open-source framework to rapidly construct Bioinformatics analysis platforms on various infrastructures like local, HPC and Clouds resources. Workspace is the basic data structure in Bio-OS which encapsulates all related elements for a research project, including data, programs and tools in secondary and tertiary analysis procedures with their environments, analysis logs, and the dashborad to describe the research project. It is designed as a self-descriptive object to deposit, disseminate, publish and reproduce the research project work. Both workspace object and its sub-objects are strictly reprocucible, compatible with multiple widely useed formats. People can use the entire Workspace object or the sub-objects to aid there research work. 
## Specifications
The current version is draft-2.
## Published Workspaces
Digger, short for Digital Gallery, is the Bio-OS Workspace warehouse maintained by Guangzhou Laboratory where you can find, download and submit workspaces.
## Tools
The Bio-OS instance platforms like Miracle Cloud are the best integrated environment to browse, create, run, reproduce a Bio-OS Workspace. Moreover, using Bio-OS CLI and SDK, you can not only manipulate the entire Workspace object, but also the sub-objects in the selected Workspace
